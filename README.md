# Weight Managment
This is an app to follow the evolution of my weight and IMC, I addded a authentification feature and some goal to reach

## Tech
The backend is an API with the NodeJS Runtime, the express framework and mongodb with the mongoose package for nodejs (host on mongodb atlas)
The frontend is a basic tab ionic 4 app.

## Installation and run the API
Now the API is host on Clever Cloud so you don't habe to install it and run in local anymore

## Install and Run the frontend 
You cloned the back and the front at the same time so all you need to do is
```bash
cd ..
cd frontend
npm install
```

Once install is done, you can run the test server with 
```bash
ionic serve
```

it will open the navigator at localhost:8100, press F12 and then Ctrl + Shift + M
