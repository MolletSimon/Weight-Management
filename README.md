This is an app to follow the evolution of my weight and IMC, I addded a authentification feature and some goal to reach

## Tech
The backend is an API with the NodeJS Runtime, the express framework and mongodb with the mongoose package for nodejs (host on mongodb atlas)
The frontend is a basic tab ionic 4 app.

## Installation and run the API
Clone the project with this command
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MolletSimon/Weight-Management.git
```

Once the project clone, go to the backend and install the node_modules with the command 
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```
after that you can the server on your localhost with the command
```bash
npm start
```
or if you got the package nodemon installed on your device you can run 
```bash
nodemon server
```

## Install and Run the frontend 
You cloned the back and the front at the same time so all you need to do is
```bash
cd ..
cd frontend
npm install
```

Once install is done, you can run the test server with 
```bash
ionic serve

it will open the navigator at localhost:8100, press F12 and then Ctrl + Shift + M
